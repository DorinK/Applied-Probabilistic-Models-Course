# Applied Probabilistic Models Course
Master's course of Prof. Ido Dagan at Bar-Ilan University on the "language" of probabilistic modeling - basic models, estimation and learning methods. Including: probability concepts and definitions, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, hidden variables, Bayesian models, classification, clustering, Expectation-Maximization algorithm and information theory basics.

**<ins>Second Assignment in 'Applied Probabilistic Models':</ins>**

In this exercise we explored different methods to estimate the probability of seen and yet unseen events.
We used a development set to learn different language models and compare them according to their perplexity on a test set.
We also implemented two smoothing methods:
* Lidstone model training 
* Held out model training

**<ins>Third Assignment in 'Applied Probabilistic Models':</ins>**

In this exercise we implemented the EM clustering algorithm for unsupervised classification of articles into clusters. 

**<ins>Score for both exercises:</ins>** 100
